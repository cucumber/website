# Cucumber reference

Cucumber can be used to implement automated tests based on scenarios described in your Gherkin feature files.

## Step Arguments

In the example given in [step definitions](/docs/cucumber/step-definitions), Cucumber extracts the text `48` from the step, converts it to an `int`
and passes it as an argument to the <Term>stepdef-body</Term>.

The number of parameters in the <Term>stepdef-body</Term> has to match the number of <Term>expression-parameter</Term>s in the expression. (If there is a mismatch, Cucumber will throw an error).

## Data Tables

Data tables from Gherkin can be accessed by using the `DataTable` object as the last parameter in a step definition.
This conversion can be done either by Cucumber or manually.

Depending on the table shape as one of the following collections:

```java
List<List<String>> table
List<Map<String, String>> table
Map<String, String> table
Map<String, List<String>> table
Map<String, Map<String, String>> table
```

    </Tab>

The simplest way to pass a list of strings to a step definition is to use a data table:

```gherkin
Given the following animals:
  | cow   |
  | horse |
  | sheep |
```

<Tabs>
    <Tab value="java">

Declare the argument as a `List<String>` but don't define any capture group in the expression.

Annotated method style:

```java
@Given("the following animals:")
public void the_following_animals(List<String> animals) {
}
```

In this case, the `DataTable` is automatically flattened to a list of strings by Cucumber (using `DataTable.asList(String.class)`) before invoking the step definition.

In addition to collections of `String`, `Integer`, `Float`, `BigInteger` and `BigDecimal`, `Byte`,
`Short`, `Long` and `Double` are also supported.

For now, Cucumber Scala does not support using Scala collection types, see [this issue](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm-scala/issues/50).
