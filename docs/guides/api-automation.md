# API automation

Cucumber is not an API automation tool, but it works well with other API automation tools.

Using API's for your automation, can make your tests faster and less flaky than going through the UI.
In general, API's change less frequently than the UI; keeping your automation up to date for longer.

## For JVM

- [RestAssured](http://rest-assured.io/) is an API automation tool for Java. You can use RestAssured in your step definitions to make API calls and verify responses.

## For JavaScript

- [PactumJS](https://pactumjs.github.io/) is a REST API Testing Tool for all levels in a Test Pyramid. For more information see the [official docs](https://pactumjs.github.io/) and [boilerplate code](https://github.com/pactumjs/pactum-cucumber-boilerplate).
