# Upgrading

We add new features to Cucumber periodically. This means you may want to upgrade to a newer version to take advantage of these new features, as well as any bug fixes.

## Versioning

Cucumber follows the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) specification for release numbers.
Essentially, this means that:

* If only the right-hand (patch) number in the release changes, you don't need to worry.
* If the middle number (minor) number in the release changes, you don't need to worry.
* If the left-hand (major) number changes, you can expect that things might break.

## Release
