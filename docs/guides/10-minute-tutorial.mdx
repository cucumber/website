# 10-minute tutorial

In this quick tutorial you will learn how to:

* Install Cucumber
* Write your first scenario using the Gherkin syntax
* Write your first step definition in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript or Ruby
* Run Cucumber
* Learn the basic workflow of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)

We'll use Cucumber to develop a small library that can figure out whether it's
Friday yet.

:::warning[Prerequisites]
This tutorial assumes that you have:

* A basic understanding of your chosen programming language and its standard tooling
* Some experience using a terminal
* Some experience using a text editor
:::

Before we begin, you'll need the following:

<Tabs>
    <Tab lang="java">
        - [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
        - A build tool. You can choose between:
        - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) - version 3.3.1 or higher
        - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (which will be used in this tutorial)
        - [IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java)
        - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) (a good alternative if you don't use IntelliJ IDEA)
        - [Cucumber Eclipse](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/)
    </Tab>
    <Tab lang="kotlin">
        - [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html) (Java 9 and higher are not yet supported by Cucumber)
        - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) - version 3.3.1 or higher
        - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (which will be used in this tutorial)
        - [IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java)
        - [IntelliJ IDEA Kotlin plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin)
        - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) (a good alternative if you don't use IntelliJ IDEA)
        - [Cucumber Eclipse](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/)
        - [Kotlin Eclipse](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse)
    </Tab>
    <Tab lang="javascript">
        - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
        - A text editor

        Open a terminal to verify that Node.js is installed properly:

        ```shell
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```

        Both of these commands should print a version number.
    </Tab>
    <Tab lang="ruby">
        - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
        - [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
        - A text editor

        Open a terminal to verify that Ruby is installed properly:

        ```shell
        ruby -v
        bundle -v
        ```

        Both of these commands should print a version number.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
