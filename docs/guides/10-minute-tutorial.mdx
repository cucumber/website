# 10-minute tutorial

<Tabs once="java,kotlin,javascript,ruby" />

In this quick tutorial you will learn how to:

* Install Cucumber
* Write your first scenario using the Gherkin syntax
* Write your first step definition in <Term>language</Term>
* Run Cucumber
* Learn the basic workflow of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)

We'll use Cucumber to develop a small library that can figure out whether it's
Friday yet.

* A basic understanding of your chosen programming language and its standard tooling
* Some experience using a terminal
* Some experience using a text editor

Before we begin, you'll need the following:

<Content lang="java">
    - [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
    - A build tool. You can choose between:
    - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) - version 3.3.1 or higher
    - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (which will be used in this tutorial)
    - [IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java)
    - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) (a good alternative if you don't use IntelliJ IDEA)
    - [Cucumber Eclipse](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/)
</Content>
<Content lang="kotlin">
    - [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html) (Java 9 and higher are not yet supported by Cucumber)
    - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) - version 3.3.1 or higher
    - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (which will be used in this tutorial)
    - [IntelliJ IDEA Cucumber for Java plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7212-cucumber-for-java)
    - [IntelliJ IDEA Kotlin plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6954-kotlin)
    - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) (a good alternative if you don't use IntelliJ IDEA)
    - [Cucumber Eclipse](https://cucumber.github.io/cucumber-eclipse/)
    - [Kotlin Eclipse](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-eclipse)
</Content>
<Content lang="javascript">
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
    - A text editor

    Open a terminal to verify that Node.js is installed properly:

    ```shell
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

    Both of these commands should print a version number.
</Content>
<Content lang="ruby">
    - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
    - [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
    - A text editor

    Open a terminal to verify that Ruby is installed properly:

    ```shell
    ruby -v
    bundle -v
    ```

    Both of these commands should print a version number.
</Content>

## Create an empty Cucumber project

<Content lang="java,kotlin">
    We'll start by creating a new project directory with the `cucumber-archetype`
    Maven plugin. Open a terminal, go to the directory where you want to create your project,
    and run the following command:

    ```shell
    mvn archetype:generate                     \
    "-DarchetypeGroupId=io.cucumber"           \
    "-DarchetypeArtifactId=cucumber-archetype" \
    "-DarchetypeVersion={{% version "cucumberjvm" %}}"                \
    "-DgroupId=hellocucumber"                  \
    "-DartifactId=hellocucumber"               \
    "-Dpackage=hellocucumber"                  \
    "-Dversion=1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"                 \
    "-DinteractiveMode=false"
    ```

    You should get something like the following result:
    ```shell
    [INFO] Project created from Archetype in dir: [directory where you created the project]/cucumber
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

    Change into the directory that was just created by running the following command:

    ```shell
    cd hellocucumber
    ```

    Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:

    * **File -> Open... -> (Select the pom.xml)**
    * Select **Open as Project**
</Content>
<Content lang="kotlin">
    To use Kotlin, we need to add it to our project:

    * Add a directory named `kotlin` in your `src/test` directory and mark it as `Test Sources Root`.
    In IntelliJ IDEA, you can do so by right-clicking on the `kotlin` directory and selecting **"Mark Directory as" > "Test Sources Root"**.
    * Create the `hellocucumber` package inside the `kotlin` directory.
    * Create a Kotlin class called `RunCucumberTest` inside the `hellocucumber` package. IntelliJ IDEA might tell you that Kotlin is not configured; click **"Configure"**.
    Your `pom.xml` should now look like this:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <project xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    </project>
    ```
    * Copy the annotations from the `RunCucumberTest.java` class to the `RunCucumberTest.kt` class.
    If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, it will offer to translate the Java code to Kotlin code. Otherwise, you'll have to write your own.

    Your `RunCucumberTest.kt` class should now look like this:
    ```kotlin
    package hellocucumber

    import io.cucumber.junit.platform.engine.Constants
    import org.junit.platform.suite.api.ConfigurationParameter
    import org.junit.platform.suite.api.IncludeEngines
    import org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectClasspathResource
    import org.junit.platform.suite.api.Suite

    @Suite
    @IncludeEngines("cucumber")
    @SelectClasspathResource("hellocucumber")
    @ConfigurationParameter(key = Constants.PLUGIN_PROPERTY_NAME, value = "pretty")
    class RunCucumberTest
    ```

    * Now you can delete the `RunCucumberTest.java` class.
    * Create a Kotlin class called `StepDefs` inside the `hellocucumber` package.
    * Copy the import statements from `StepDefinitions.java` to `StepDefs.kt`; you'll need them later.
    * Finally, delete the `StepDefinitions.java` class (or even the `java` directory).
</Content>
<Content lang="javascript">
    We'll start by creating a new directory and an empty Node.js project.

    ```shell
    mkdir hellocucumber
    cd hellocucumber
    npm init --yes
    ```

    Add Cucumber as a development dependency:

    ```shell
    npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber
    ```

    Open `package.json` in a text editor and change the `test` section so it looks like this:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "hellocucumber",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "",
        "main": "index.js",
        "scripts": {
            "test": "cucumber-js"
        },
        "keywords": [],
        "author": "",
        "license": "ISC",
        "devDependencies": {
            "@cucumber/cucumber": "^{{% version "cucumberjs" %}}"
        }
    }
    ```

    Prepare the file structure:

    ```shell
    mkdir features
    mkdir features/step_definitions
    ```

    Create a file called `cucumber.json` at the root of your project and add the following
    content:

    ```json
    {
        "default": {
            "formatOptions": {
                "snippetInterface": "synchronous"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Also, create a file called `features/step_definitions/stepdefs.js` with the
    following content:

    ```javascript
    const assert = require('assert');
    const { Given, When, Then } = require('@cucumber/cucumber');
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="ruby">
    We'll start by creating a new directory and an empty Ruby project.

    ```shell
    mkdir hellocucumber
    cd hellocucumber
    ```

    Create a `Gemfile` with the following content:

    ```ruby
    source "https://rubygems.org"

    group :test do
        gem 'cucumber', '~> {{% version "cucumberruby" %}}'
        gem 'rspec', '~> {{% version "rspec" %}}'
    end
    ```

    Install Cucumber and prepare the file structure:

    ```shell
    bundle install
    cucumber --init
    ```
</Content>

You now have a small project with Cucumber installed.

## Verify your installation

To make sure everything works together correctly, let's run Cucumber.

<Content lang="java,kotlin">
    ```shell
    mvn test
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="javascript">
    ```shell
    npm test
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="ruby">
    ```shell
    cucumber
    ```
</Content>

You should see something like the following:

<Content lang="java,kotlin">
    ```shell
    -------------------------------------------------------
    T E S T S
    -------------------------------------------------------

    Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

    Results :

    Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="javascript">
    ```shell
    0 scenarios
    0 steps
    0m00.000s
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="ruby">
    ```shell
    0 scenarios
    0 steps
    0m0.000s
    ```
</Content>

Cucumber's output is telling us that it didn't find anything to run.

## Write a scenario

When we do Behaviour-Driven Development with Cucumber we use *concrete examples*
to specify *what* we want the software to do. Scenarios are written *before*
production code. They start their life as an *executable specification*. As
the production code emerges, scenarios take on a role as *living documentation* and
*automated tests*.

:::tip[Example Mapping]
Try running an [Example Mapping](/docs/bdd/example-mapping) workshop in your team to
design examples together.
:::

In Cucumber, an example is called a [scenario](/docs/gherkin/reference#example).
Scenarios are defined in `.feature` files, which are stored in the
<Content lang="java,kotlin">`src/test/resources/hellocucumber`</Content>
<Content lang="javascript,ruby">`features`</Content>
directory (or a subdirectory).

One concrete example would be that *Sunday isn't Friday*.

Create an empty file called
<Content lang="java,kotlin">`src/test/resources/hellocucumber/is_it_friday_yet.feature`</Content>
<Content lang="javascript,ruby">`features/is_it_friday_yet.feature`</Content>
with the following content:

```gherkin
Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario: Sunday isn't Friday
    Given today is Sunday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "Nope"
```

The first line of this file starts with the keyword `Feature:` followed by a name.
It's a good idea to use a name similar to the file name.

The second line is a brief description of the feature. Cucumber does not
execute this line because it's documentation.

The fourth line, `Scenario: Sunday is not Friday` is a
[scenario](../gherkin/reference.md#example), which is a *concrete example* illustrating how
the software should behave.

The last three lines starting with `Given`, `When` and `Then` are the
[steps](../gherkin/reference.md#steps) of our scenario. This is what Cucumber will execute.

## See scenario reported as undefined

Now that we have a scenario, we can ask Cucumber to execute it.

<Content lang="java,kotlin">
    ```shell
    mvn test
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="javascript">
    ```shell
    npm test
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="ruby">
    ```shell
    cucumber
    ```
</Content>

Cucumber is telling us we have one `undefined` scenario and three `undefined`
steps. It's also suggesting some snippets of code that we can use to
*define* these steps:

<Content lang="java,kotlin">
```shell
-------------------------------------------------------

    Unfortunately, Cucumber does not generate snippets in Kotlin. But fortunately IDEA can convert the Java code to Kotlin code for you. You might need to improve the translated code, to make it more idiomatic.
    You might also need to add the following import statements (if you hadn't already).

    Your `StepDefs.kt` file should now look like this:

    ```kotlin
    package hellocucumber

    import io.cucumber.java.PendingException
    import io.cucumber.java.en.Given
    import io.cucumber.java.en.When
    import io.cucumber.java.en.Then
    import org.junit.Assert.*

    class StepDefs {
        @Given("today is Sunday")
        @Throws(Exception::class)
        fun today_is_Sunday() {
            // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
            throw PendingException()
        }

        @When("I ask whether it's Friday yet")
        @Throws(Exception::class)
        fun i_ask_whether_it_s_Friday_yet() {
            // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
            throw PendingException()
        }

        @Then("I should be told {string}")
        @Throws(Exception::class)
        fun i_should_be_told(arg1: String) {

Cucumber found our step definitions and executed them. They are currently marked as
*pending*, which means we need to make them do something useful.

## See scenario reported as failing

The next step is to do what the comments in the step definitions is telling us to do:

> Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions

Try to use the same words in the code as in the steps.

:::tip[Ubiquitous language]
If the words in your steps originated from conversations during an
[Example Mapping](/docs/bdd/example-mapping) session, you're building a
[Ubiquitous Language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html),
which we believe is a great way to make your production code and tests more understandable and easier to maintain.

Change your step definition code to this:

Congratulations! You've got your first green Cucumber scenario.

## Add another failing test

The next thing to test for would be that we also get the correct result when it *is* Friday.

Update the `is_it_friday_yet.feature` file:

```gherkin
Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario: Sunday isn't Friday
    Given today is Sunday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "Nope"

  Scenario: Friday is Friday
    Given today is Friday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "TGIF"
```

We'll need to add a step definition to set `today` to "Friday":

<Content lang="java">
    ```java
    @Given("today is Friday")
    public void today_is_Friday() {
        today = "Friday";
    }
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    @Given("today is Friday")
    fun today_is_Friday() {
        today = "Friday"
    }
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="javascript">
    ```javascript
    Given('today is Friday', function () {
      this.today = 'Friday';
    });
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="ruby">
    ```ruby
    Given("today is Friday") do
      @today = 'Friday'
    end
    ```
</Content>

When we run this test, it will fail.

That is because we haven't implemented the logic yet! Let's do that next.

## Make it pass

We should update our statement to actually evaluate whether or not `today` is equal to `"Friday"`.

<Content lang="java">
    ```java
    static String isItFriday(String today) {
        return "Friday".equals(today) ? "TGIF" : "Nope";
    }
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    fun isItFriday(today: String) = if (today == "Friday") "TGIF" else "Nope"
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="javascript">
    ```javascript
    function isItFriday(today) {
      if (today === "Friday") {
        return "TGIF";
      } else {
        return "Nope";
      }
    }
    ```
</Content>
<Content lang="ruby">
    ```ruby
    def is_it_friday(day)
      if day == 'Friday'
        'TGIF'
      else
        'Nope'
      end

## Using variables and examples

So, we all know that there are more days in the week than just Sunday and Friday. Let's update our scenario to use variables and evaluate more possibilities. We'll use variables and examples to evaluate Friday, Sunday, and anything else!

Update the `is_it_friday_yet.feature` file. Notice how we go from `Scenario` to `Scenario Outline` when we start using multiple `Examples`.

```gherkin
Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario Outline: Today is or is not Friday
    Given today is "<day>"
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "<answer>"

  Examples:
    | day            | answer |
    | Friday         | TGIF   |
    | Sunday         | Nope   |
    | anything else! | Nope   |
```

We need to replace the step definitions for `today is Sunday` and `today is Friday` with one step definition that takes the value of `<day>` as a String.
Update the step definitions as follows:

<Content lang="java">
```java
package hellocucumber;

import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;

        return "Friday".equals(today) ? "TGIF" : "Nope";
    }
}

    private String today;
    private String actualAnswer;

    @Given("today is {string}")
    public void today_is(String today) {
        this.today = today;
    }

    @When("I ask whether it's Friday yet")
    public void i_ask_whether_it_s_Friday_yet() {
        actualAnswer = IsItFriday.isItFriday(today);
    }

## Refactoring

Now that we have working code, we should do some refactoring:

* We should move the `isItFriday` <Term>stepdef-body</Term> out from the test code into production code.
* We could at some point extract helper methods from our step definition, for <Term>stepdef-body</Term>s we use in several places.

## Summary

In this brief tutorial you've seen how to install Cucumber, how to follow
the BDD process to develop a <Term>stepdef-body</Term>, and how to use that <Term>stepdef-body</Term> to evaluate multiple scenarios!
