# Installation

Cucumber is available for most mainstream programming languages.
We recommend choosing an implementation for the same platform or
programming language as the production code.

* <StatusBadge status="official"/> implementations are hosted under [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber).
* <StatusBadge status="semi-official"/> implementations are hosted elsewhere, but use components from [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber).
* <StatusBadge status="unofficial"/> implementations are hosted elsewhere and don't use any components from [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber).
* <StatusBadge status="unmaintained"/> implementations are official, but unmaintained and in need of new maintainers.
