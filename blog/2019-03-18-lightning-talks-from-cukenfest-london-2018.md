Towards the end of the first day of [CukenFest London](http://cukenfest.cucumber.io), we allow anyone from the audience to take to the stage to give a short, two-minute talk on a topic they think might interest an audience of BDD enthusiasts. It turns out this is always a lot of fun. In 2018 we had some excellent lightning talks including ones about mob programming, getting into tech without a tech background, and how wool can help you solve tricky software problems. In total we had 9 lightning talks, all of which are now on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrQMyTCtW0DZF7xWCENbMyMc99o1Bap_1).

I'm very much looking forward to the lightning talks sessions when CukenFest returns next month.

Cya in a few weeks!
