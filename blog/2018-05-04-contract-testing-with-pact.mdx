This month on the Cucumber Podcast we speak to [Beth Skurrie](https://twitter.com/bethesque), who is the maintainer of the open-source project, Pact. Pact falls into the category of contract testing and with the advent of microservices and continuous delivery, it's getting more and more important. [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose) takes the hosting duties with extra questions from [Steve Tooke](https://twitter.com/tooky).
