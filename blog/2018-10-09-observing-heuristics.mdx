This week on the Cucumber Podcast, Sal Freudenberg and Matt Wynne speak to Rebecca Wirfs-Brock. Rebecca is probably best known as an author of Designing Object-Oriented Software (1990) and Object Design (2002). For the past couple of months, Rebecca has jumped on the Cucumber Pro mob (read mob programming) to watch the team, notice heuristics, and contribute. The conversation follows that journey and how other teams can notice heuristics and ultimately deliver higher-quality software.
