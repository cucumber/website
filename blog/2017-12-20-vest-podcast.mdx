A bit of festive magic for you. We have invited Marcin Floyran and Sebastian Lambla back onto the podcast to discuss VeST (Vertical Slice Technologies). They were last on the podcast about two years ago to talk about Agile Anarchy and we asked them back to talk about VeST. So here it is. Aslak is asking the questions. This is a great listen for those who are interested in building customer-centric, high-quality software products.
