This month, [Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne) and [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose) sat down with [Richard Lawrence](https://twitter.com/rslawrence) and [Paul Rayner](https://twitter.com/thepaulrayner) to talk about their new book "[Behavior-Driven Development with Cucumber](https://www.amazon.com/Behavior-Driven-Development-Cucumber-Specification-Example/dp/0321772636)". The book incorporates their many combined years of experience teaching BDD to agile teams.
