This month on the Cucumber Podcast, we speak about The Screenplay Pattern. As John Ferguson [describes it on his site](http://serenity-bdd.info/docs/articles/screenplay-tutorial.html), "the Screenplay Pattern is a powerful and elegant approach to designing and implementing automated tests, providing a number of improvements over more traditional approaches such as the Page Objects model."

The conversation covers why you should consider following the Screenplay Pattern and its potential drawbacks. The conversation closes with our guests providing a single tip for folks looking to try out the Screenplay Pattern on their own. Joining your host Aslak Helles√∏y are John Smart, Jan Molak, Angie Jones, Nat Pryce, Matt Wynne and Steve Tooke.
