This month on the Cucumber podcast we speak to Llewellyn Falco. He's best known for two things: approval testing and mob programming. As we've covered mobbing in great detail on the pod lately, we dig into approval testing. Pitching questions from the Cucumber team are Steve Tooke, Aslak Hellesoy, and Seb Rose.
