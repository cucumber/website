When creating our scenarios, we want to fully describe the desired functionality, but not over-describe it. We want our scenarios to do more than check for correct operation. We want to paint a picture of whatâ€™s intended that aids understanding by others (or even ourselves) in the future. Which details should we leave visible, and which should we hide?
