This month on the Cucumber podcast, Aslak Helles√∏y and Steve Tooke speak to Kenny Baas and Bruno Boucard about the relationship between Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). While both share many similarities, there isn't a great deal of crossover between the two communities. Our two guests want to change that by demonstrating that both practices and communities have more in common than they may think.
