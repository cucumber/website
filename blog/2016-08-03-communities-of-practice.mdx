Today we’re going to be talking about communities of practice and exploring how they can support learning in your company. Communities of practice are “formed by people who engage in a process of collective learning in a shared domain of human endeavor”.

To join us to discuss the subject we’ve invited [Emily Webber](https://twitter.com/ewebber), an independent agile and lean consultant, who has recently published her book “Building Successful Communities of Practice”. This week’s host, [Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne), is also joined by our podcast regulars, [Arti Mathanda](https://twitter.com/artismarti) and [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose).
