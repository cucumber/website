This month on the Cucumber Podcast, we sat down with [Janet Gregory](https://twitter.com/janetgregoryca) and [Lisa Crispin](https://twitter.com/lisacrispin) to talk about their latest book, [Agile Testing Condensed](https://leanpub.com/agiletesting-condensed). Between them, they have a wealth of real-world experience helping agile teams think differently about testing. This conversation not only covers what you can expect to find in their book, but a wide-range of stories of best practices and the role of testers over the years. [Matt Wynne](https://twitter.com/mattwynne) and [Seb Rose](https://twitter.com/sebrose) are asking the questions.
