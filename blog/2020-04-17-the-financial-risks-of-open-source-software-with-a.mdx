This month we dig into the financial risks of open-source software. Cucumber's success has led to many of the world's most valuable companies relying on its software for critical parts of their codebase. So what are the financial risks for companies who use OSS tooling every day? And who pays when an OSS tool is no longer looked after? Chairing the conversation is Seb Rose who is joined by his colleague Dermot Canniffee. Answering the questions is Aslak Hellesøy who created Cucumber some 12 years ago.
