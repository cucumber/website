On the podcast this month, Matt Wynne speaks to Angie Jones. We first heard about Angie through her posts about BDD, Test Automation and Cucumber on her [website](https://angiejones.tech/). Her blog is a treat, filled with lots of practical advice for modern software teams. Angie now works for Twitter as an Automation Engineer and is a frequent conference speaker.
